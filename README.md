## Address Book Manager

This is a sample Address Book created as a practice with Facebook's Flux architecture and using React for UI components. Feel free to fork and play around with it.

## Quickstart

The project dependencies are not included in this repository. To install all the dependencies you will need NPM. Run this command in the main directory:

```bash
npm install
```

Also run this to create bundle.js with browserify, it will update the file everytime you make a change in your JavaScript files.

```bash
npm start
```

## Note

Depending on what version of Node you have you might have to use nodejs-legacy to get some npm packages running.


```bash
apt-get install nodejs-legacy
```

## TODO

1. Get ordering and sorting systems in place use Lists.js
2. Incorporate even faster UI by using optimistic rendering updates.
3. Flesh out the Google Material Design CSS framework.
